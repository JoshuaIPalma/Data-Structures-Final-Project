Course: DATA STRUCTURES (Fall 2025)

============================================================

## 1. Build and Run Instructions

### 1.1. Prerequisites
-Java Development Kit (JDK)

### 1.2. Project Structure
-The source code is located in the package directory:
 src/edu/hcu/triage/

### 1.3. How to Run
Run the main application class, HospitalApp. It accepts one optional argument for the seed data file.
java edu.hcu.triage.HospitalApp [path/to/patients.csv]

* The application will start with a **Command Line Interface (CLI) menu**.
* The system should gracefully handle invalid inputs and never crash.

## 2. Design Decisions and Data Structures

The system uses three core data structures as required:

| Component | Data Structure | Rationale (Why was this structure chosen?) |
| Patient Registry | HashMap<String, Patient> | Provides O(1) (average time) lookup and storage by the unique patient ID. |
| Triage Queue | PriorityQueue<Patient> | Ensures the patient with the highest severity is always dequeued next, with O(log n) performance for enqueue/dequeue. |
| Triage Ordering | TriageOrder Comparator | Custom Comparator to implement the stable triage policy: 1) Higher severity first. 2) Smaller arrivalSeq for ties (FIFO). |
| Treatment Log | LinkedList<TreatedCase> | Chosen for O(1) append-only operation, maintaining a chronological log of treated patients. |

---

## 3. Key Invariants and Policies

### 3.1. Patient Identity and Equality
* The Patient object's equals()* and hashCode() methods are based **only on the 'id' field. This ensures correctness in the HashMap registry.

### 3.2. Severity Update Policy
* When a patient's severity is updated in the PatientRegistry, their position in the TriageQueue is NOT automatically changed.
* To re-triage a patient, they must be explicitly re-enqueued (or state your chosen policy clearly, especially if implementing the Extra Credit feature).

### 3.3. Triage Stability
* The TriageOrder Comparator ensures that for any two patients with equal severity, the one with the earlier arrival sequence number (FIFO) is prioritized.

### 3.4. Input/CSV Handling
* CLI Inputs: All user inputs are validated (e.g., bounds for age/severity, non-empty IDs) to prevent crashes.
* CSV Load: The CsvIO utility will skip malformed lines in patients.csv and print a warning with the line number to the console.

---

## 4. Known Issues

### 4.1. Known Issues
* [List any current bugs, limitations, or incomplete features here. E.g., "The CsvIO utility does not currently handle commas within the 'notes' field upon export."]
* [Example: "The 'update patient' CLI command requires re-entering all patient fields, not just the field to be updated."]
